    <h1>Full Stack Web Development Tech Stack</h1>
    <dl>
        <dt>MEAN Stack</dt>
        <dd>The MEAN stack is a collection of JavaScript-based technologies: MongoDB (database), Express.js (web application framework), Angular (front-end framework), and Node.js (runtime environment). It's used for building dynamic web applications.</dd>

        <dt>MERN Stack</dt>
        <dd>The MERN stack is similar to MEAN but uses React instead of Angular for the front-end. It consists of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It's popular for building single-page applications (SPAs).</dd>

        <dt>LAMP Stack</dt>
        <dd>The LAMP stack includes Linux (operating system), Apache (web server), MySQL (database management system), and PHP (server-side scripting language). It's commonly used for building traditional web applications.</dd>

        <dt>JAMstack</dt>
        <dd>JAMstack is an architecture for building fast and secure websites. It stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. It often uses static site generators and decouples the front end from the back end for improved performance and scalability.</dd>

        <dt>Ruby on Rails</dt>
        <dd>Ruby on Rails, often simply called Rails, is a web application framework written in Ruby. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and is known for its developer-friendly conventions. It's used for building web applications quickly.</dd>

        <dt>Python Django</dt>
        <dd>Python Django is a high-level web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It includes many built-in features for handling common web development tasks, making it efficient for developers.</dd>

        <dt>Vue.js</dt>
        <dd>Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It's often used for building interactive and responsive front-end applications.</dd>

        <dt>GraphQL</dt>
        <dd>GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. It provides more flexibility than traditional REST APIs and is often used in combination with various back-end technologies.</dd>

        <dt>Serverless</dt>
        <dd>Serverless computing allows developers to build and run applications without managing server infrastructure. Services like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions are commonly used in serverless architectures.</dd>
